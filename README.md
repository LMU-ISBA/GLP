# AI as Ally: Collaborating with Tech

This 90-minute, hands-on workshop teaches you how to partner with AI as a creative teammate to amplify your problem-solving and creative abilities. Through a practical project, participants will learn to develop a web application designed to address a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). The session breaks down prompt engineering into key components like role, context, and task , guiding you through exercises that range from conducting deep research to generating an elevator pitch and building an app. You will leave with an understanding of how to move beyond giving simple commands and instead start thoughtful conversations with AI, enabling you to think more critically and make better decisions.
