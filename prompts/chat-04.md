## üöÄ Step-by-Step Prompt Creation

### üìù **Step 1: Define Your ROLE**

Establish the AI's expertise for development tasks.

**Example Role:**
```markdown
ROLE: You are an expert full-stack developer and UX/UI designer specializing in creating compelling landing pages for social impact startups. You excel at translating business concepts into user-friendly, conversion-optimized web experiences.
```

### üåç **Step 2: Build Comprehensive CONTEXT**

Combine all previous research and visual inspiration.

#### **Context Component 1: Project Foundation**
```markdown
CONTEXT:
- SDG Focus: [Insert your chosen SDG from Chat 01]
- Target Audience: [From your Chat 01 career counselor responses]
- Research Insights: [Key findings from Chat 02 deep research]
- Elevator Pitch: [Your final pitch from Chat 03]
```

#### **Context Component 2: Visual Design Reference**
- **UI Mockup**: Upload image from Dribbble or design inspiration
- **Design Style**: Modern, clean, professional, accessible
- **Brand Personality**: [Based on your SDG and target audience]

#### **Context Component 3: Technical Requirements**
```markdown
- Platform: Web application (responsive design)
- Purpose: Landing page for startup pitch competition demo
- Timeline: Rapid prototype development
- Framework: [Specify if needed, e.g., React, Vue, or let AI choose]
```

### üéØ **Step 3: Define Your TASK**

Be specific about deliverables and requirements.

**Core Task:**
```markdown
TASK: Create a compelling landing page for my SDG-focused web application that includes:

1. Hero section with elevator pitch integration
2. Problem/solution explanation
3. Key features overview
4. SDG impact demonstration
5. Call-to-action for demo/signup
6. Contact/about section

The landing page should be suitable for presentation at a startup pitch competition and effectively communicate the value proposition to both judges and potential users.
```

### üìö **Step 4: Provide EXAMPLES**

Reference proven frameworks and structures.

**Example Framework - PRD for AI Prototyping:**
```markdown
EXAMPLES:
Use a startup landing page structure:
- Hero: Problem statement + solution in one compelling headline
- Social Proof: SDG alignment and impact metrics
- Features: 3-4 key capabilities with icons/visuals
- Demo/Preview: Screenshot or video placeholder
- CTA: Primary action (Try Demo, Sign Up, Learn More)
- Footer: Contact, social links, additional resources

Reference sites like: Stripe, Notion, or Figma for clean, conversion-focused design patterns.
```

### üìÑ **Step 5: Specify OUTPUT FORMAT**

Ensure the result is exactly what you need.

```markdown
OUTPUT FORMAT:
- LLM-friendly Markdown with clear sections
- Include HTML/CSS/JavaScript code blocks
- Provide component-based structure
- Add comments explaining design decisions
- Include placeholder content that can be easily customized
- Responsive design considerations noted
```

### üó£Ô∏è **Step 6: Set Clear TONE**

Eliminate ambiguity in requirements.

```markdown
TONE: 
- No ambiguity in technical specifications
- Clear, actionable instructions
- Professional yet approachable copy
- Emphasize social impact and innovation
- Maintain startup energy and optimism
```

### ü§ñ **Step 7: Select Reasoning MODEL**

Choose models that excel at structured thinking.

**Recommended Models:**
- **OpenAI o3**: For complex development planning
- **Claude 4 Opus**: For design and UX reasoning
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: For comprehensive solution architecture
