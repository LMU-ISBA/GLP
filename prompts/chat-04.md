## üéØ Understanding the Task

**Your Goal**: Create an optimized prompt that you'll then use with AI coding agents to build your landing page.

**The Process**:
1. **In Chat 04 (ChatGPT/Claude)**: Build a comprehensive prompt using the framework below
2. **Then in Lovable/Bolt**: Submit that prompt to generate your actual landing page

## ü§ñ Understanding AI Coding Agents

AI coding agents like Lovable are specialized tools that can:
- **Generate Complete Applications**: Create full-stack web apps from descriptions
- **Understand Design Context**: Interpret UI mockups and design requirements
- **Implement Best Practices**: Follow modern development standards and frameworks
- **Iterate Rapidly**: Make changes based on feedback and requirements

- **Design Style**: Modern, clean, professional, accessible
- **Brand Personality**: [Based on your SDG and target audience]

#### **Context Component 3: Technical Requirements**
```markdown
- Platform: Web application (responsive design)
- Purpose: Landing page for startup pitch competition demo
- Timeline: Rapid prototype development
- Framework: [Specify if needed, e.g., React, Vue, or let AI choose]
```

### üéØ **Step 3: Define Your TASK**

Be specific about what you want ChatGPT/Claude to help you create.

**Core Task:**
```markdown
### TASK:
Create an optimized LLM prompt for an AI coding agent (like Lovable) that will generate a compelling, responsive landing page for my SDG-focused web application.

The prompt should instruct the coding agent to build a landing page that includes:
1. Hero section with elevator pitch integration
2. Problem/solution explanation
3. Key features overview
4. SDG impact demonstration
5. Call-to-action for demo/signup
6. Contact/about section

The prompt should specify technical requirements:
- Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Clean, modern aesthetic suitable for startup pitch competition
- Fast loading and accessible
- Include placeholder content that can be easily customized
- Use semantic HTML and proper CSS structure

Output in a markdown block.
```

### üìö **Step 4: Provide EXAMPLES**

Reference proven frameworks and structures.

**Example Framework - PRD for AI Prototyping:**
```markdown
EXAMPLES:
Use a startup landing page structure:
- Hero: Problem statement + solution in one compelling headline
- Social Proof: SDG alignment and impact metrics
- Features: 3-4 key capabilities with icons/visuals
- Demo/Preview: Screenshot or video placeholder
- CTA: Primary action (Try Demo, Sign Up, Learn More)
- Footer: Contact, social links, additional resources

Reference sites like: Stripe, Notion, or Figma for clean, conversion-focused design patterns.
```

### üìÑ **Step 5: Specify OUTPUT FORMAT**

Ensure the result is exactly what you need.

```markdown
OUTPUT FORMAT:
- LLM-friendly Markdown with clear sections
- Include HTML/CSS/JavaScript code blocks
- Provide component-based structure
- Add comments explaining design decisions
- Include placeholder content that can be easily customized
- Responsive design considerations noted
```

### üó£Ô∏è **Step 6: Set Clear TONE**

Eliminate ambiguity in requirements.

```markdown
TONE: 
- No ambiguity in technical specifications
- Clear, actionable instructions
- Professional yet approachable copy
- Emphasize social impact and innovation
- Maintain startup energy and optimism
```

### ü§ñ **Step 7: Select Reasoning MODEL**

Choose models that excel at structured thinking.

**Recommended Models:**
- **OpenAI o3**: For complex development planning
- **Claude 4 Opus**: For design and UX reasoning
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: For comprehensive solution architecture
