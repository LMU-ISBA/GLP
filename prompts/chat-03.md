## 🚀 Step-by-Step Pitch Development

### 📝 **Step 1: Define Your ROLE**

Start by establishing the AI's expertise for your specific SDG.

**Example Prompt:**
```markdown
What is an effective role I can assign to an LLM to support me in building a web application that addresses SDG 4? Output in markdown.
```

**Alternative Approach:** Ask your group for role suggestions, then validate with AI.

### 🌍 **Step 2: Build Rich CONTEXT**

Combine insights from your previous research to create comprehensive background.

#### **Context Component 1: Your Journey**
Run in Chat 01
```markdown
I'm building a web application to address an SDG. Summarize how I arrived at SDG 4 based on how I responded to the questions from the career counselor. Output in markdown and in the first person voice.
```

#### **Context Component 2: Research Foundation**
- Include your deep research report from Chat 02
- Reference key findings and statistics
- Highlight implementation gaps you discovered

### 🎯 **Step 3: Define Your TASK**

Be specific about what you want to achieve.

**Core Task:**
```markdown
Create a 1-sentence elevator pitch for this SDG 4 focused web application.
```

### 📚 **Step 4: Add EXAMPLES**

Provide frameworks to guide the AI's output.

1. **Research Frameworks**: Ask AI to suggest elevator pitch frameworks
2. **Select Best Framework**: Choose the most relevant for your project
3. **Apply Framework**: Use it as a template for your pitch

### 🎪 **Step 5: Experiment with TONE**

Test different communication styles to find your voice.

**Tone Variations:**
```markdown
Rewrite the pitch as a pirate.
```
```markdown
Rewrite the pitch as a business consultant using concise and succinct language.
```

**Additional Tone Options (Overlaps with ROLE):**

```

### 📋 **Analysis Table Format**

| Pitch Option | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|--------------|------|------|----------|
| Option 1 | ... | ... | ... |
